-make a separate network class for the client [DONE]
-instead of getting the name in loop get it during the first connect function [DONE]
-just need to make the player visible [DONE]
-work on constant feeback to server

so you can't use sprite as sendable objects
look up slots/dictionaries for efficient trasnfer of data
worked on a way to update sprites online and locally but isnt working

-client constatly takes players and updates them locally
-server maintains list of what all players are there in the server and gives that list to players
